# JavaStuff
Random Java Code... for now
This repository for the moment will store guided projects as well as unguided projects.
I am an undergrad student looking for my first opportunity in tech.
Feel free to do constructive criticism, otherwise, you are free to look around.
If any of the code here helps you, I am glad.
If not, I am also glad. For some people, Java is a boogeyman language.
Not sure why.
God(s) bless you! Take care! :)
